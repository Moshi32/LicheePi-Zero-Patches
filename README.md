This project was done in 2022. Very outdated.

Started with voloviq's repo (https://github.com/voloviq/meta-licheepizero) and continued with meta-licheepizero.
Contains the patches I had done to kernel. I added usb functions, python and tried a few things but got stuck after some point.

Lost interest in this for now, just uploading here if I work on it later.
